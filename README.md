## Project Description

#### **Idea Abstract**
The demand for concise and easily digestible information is increasing, particularly in the field of education where students and educators are overwhelmed with an enormous amount of information from textbooks and other materials. To address this issue, we are creating a web app that aims to convert large volumes of textual data into brief, easy-to-understand points. In addition, the application also includes features such as generating questions and answers, as well as flashcards to help students study and retain information more effectively. also provides educators with the ability to prepare a question bank based on the converted data from textbooks and other materials. This feature not only saves educators time but also helps them to prepare for exams and assess student understanding more efficiently.

- Generates questions and answers to facilitate effective learning and retention of information for students
